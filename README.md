# Reading_Group-LUT <img src="log.png" width="240" align="right">
Welcome to LUT's paper reading group repo :) This group is a guided discussion group on awesome machine learning and computer vision research papers. We meet (nearly) weekly to review a paper that we choose together. Overall, there is a lot of flexibility, and suggestions are more than welcome. The purpose of the reading group is to gently introduce postgraduates to the beauty of theory, expose people to the very frontier of research, and answer questions such as "but why? why the attention does this work?". If you are interested, register here to receive email notifications!

In this repository, you will find slidedecks and paper reproductions.
